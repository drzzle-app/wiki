## Specifications

Acceptable font file types are .tff, .otf and .woff. Be sure to name your font file clear and concise as that name will be how it is shown as an option in the editor.

Keep in mind that the more fonts you upload to a website the more assets the website will need to load when published. We recommend keeping your font count from 0-5 per website for optimal performance.
